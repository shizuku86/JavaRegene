# JavaRegene
This addon addresses the issue of slower health regeneration when the hunger bar is full in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition compared to the Java Edition. When enabled, it automatically disables the vanilla naturalRegeneration game rule and applies its own custom regeneration system.

Note:
- Achievements are disabled in worlds where this addon is applied.
